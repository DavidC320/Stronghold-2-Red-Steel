I've gotten to a point where I can create items kind of but it's tedious making them because I need to create dictionaries. So I will make a small Tkinter application to help
create items.
I think I just wasted my time.

    I've been thinking about the game and I want to have a randomly generated world in the game but I just want those randomly generated content be optional and I don't know a
    way to save generated content in this but I want to use noise so I'll make a test.

    I started making the SQL save manager but I started getting frustrated because I'm trying to solve several none existent problems that will happen.
        Predicted problems:
            How will I get the character's proficiencies
                solution - just make another table
            How will I save the player's data. I.E money, current map
                create a table for game data like user_data
            Updating save games, mostly updating
                solve it when it happens
            saving map data
                solve it when it happens

    I'm getting stuck trying to find a way to give items to the allies and I hope I can use this to clear everything
        So for my load function I want to get the data from the allies and combine it with the data from the data in Skills so I can have proficiencies
        The problem is that I want to make sure that items are given to the right ally if they have them equipped
        The items can be in either
            Storage
            Inventory
            ally
        The important one is the ally table because it contains all of the items an ally is wearing
        each ally has four equip slots
            head
            body
            legs
            weapon
        so I just need to do a for loop on all of the allies which sounds really difficult.. not really but seems inefficiency
        so I think the best thing to do is to create two lists for Inventory and Storage so that those are put up easily
        the ally table is the hard part because to make it easy to use is by creating a dictary where the id is used as the key but the value is a equipment 
        item class object
        I.E 
            {1 : Base_item(stuff)}
        this will at least get things ready
