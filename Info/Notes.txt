I've gotten to a point where I can create items kind of but it's tedious making them because I need to create dictonareis. So I will make a small tkinter application to help
create items.
I think I just wasted my time.

    I've been thinking about the game and I want to have a randomly generated world in the game but I jsut want those randomly genrated content be optional and I don't know a
    way to save generated content in this but I want to use noise so I'll make a test.
