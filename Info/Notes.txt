I've gotten to a point where I can create items kind of but it's tedious making them because I need to create dictonareis. So I will make a small tkinter application to help
create items.
I think I just wasted my time.

    way to save generated content in this but I want to use noise so I'll make a test.

    I started making the sql save manager but I started getting fustrated becasue I'm trying to solve several none existant problems that will happen.
        Predicted problems:
            How will I get the character's proficiencies
                solution - just make another table
            How will I save the player's data. I.E money, current map
                create a table for game data like user_data
            Updating save games, mostly updating
                solve it when it happens
            saving map data
