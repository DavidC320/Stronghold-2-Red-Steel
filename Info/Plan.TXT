Plan of action
1. build up
    Set up game play classes.
        character classes -

        Item classes -

        Player class -

        Inventory class -

        Start creating a SQL database as a reference -

        load and save classes
            I want to create a dynamic SQL database that can be easily modified to have more columns.
            I also want to make the player save file a whole folder that includes the SQL database and a JSON file for general information
            To make this I will need to figure out how create player save folders and then to add files into that folder.
            This folder will contain
                SQL database -
                    Allies
                    Proficiencies
                    items
                Player JSON file - last thing until 1.0.0 - 
                    Money
