Plan of action
1. build up
    Set up game play classes.
        character classes -

        Item classes -

        Player class -

        Inventory class -

        Start creating a SQL database as a reference -

        load and save classes
            I want to create a dynamic SQL database that can be easily modified to have more columns.
            I also want to make the player save file a whole folder that includes the SQL database and a JSON file for general information
            To make this I will need to figure out how create player save folders and then to add files into that folder.
            This folder will contain
                SQL database -
                    Allies
                    Proficiencies
                    items
                Player JSON file - last thing until 1.0.0 - 
                    Money

        New section
            Creating saving data for item and character classes

This has been finished

2. Create game play tests
    create a debug menu
        The debug menu is to test out different funtions of the game in one place instead of having to go to another file or play the game until
        there
    create player controller
        A test for player movement
            includes
                controller
                    wasd
                    run
                    ally switch
                energy spending

    Create a combat mockup
    create area controller
    create inventory tests
    create party changer tests
    create NPC test

3. Create the game

2. Create simple game interface
    Create UI for the game
        Start
        options
        create file
        load file
        quit
        main UI
