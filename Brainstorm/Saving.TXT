I think the best course of action for this game is to use a SQLite database to store save data.

maybe I should use a json file I'll check

"player" = [
    {
        "Money" : 0,
        "Party" : [0],
        "Map" : 0
        "inventory" : [
            0
        ]
    }
]

Ally Storage Unit
"ASU" = [
    {
        "Info" : [
            "Name" : None,
            "Dead" : None,
            "Partied" : true
        ],

        "Statictics": [
            "Health" : None,
            "Speed" : None,
            "Defence" : None,
            "Attack" : None,
            "Energy" : None
        ],

        "eqipment" : [
            "Head" : None,
            "Chest" : None,
            "Legs" : None,
            "Weapon" : None,
            "Pocket" : None
        ]
    }
]

Item Storage Unit
"ISU" : [

]
Yeah no SQL will be better but the player will be very akward

    current party Integer 
    map Text

This is not working
the problem is equipment and other items
